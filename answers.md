### UNIT 1 ###

# 1 - INTRO #
1. Why learn Angular JS over other frameworks like Ember, Backbone, Knockout, etc?
Angular JS has the largest userbase, the most documentation on sites like stackoverflow & youtube, and is sponsored by google.

2. People have some very strong opinions about Angular. What are 3 common complaints people have about Angular?
* It is enormous and complex, the learning curve is steeper than other frameworks
* There are constraints involving features like scopes & routing which can create idiosyncratic bugs and limitations
* Documentation is poor and updates/new releases can cause older codebases to require total overhaul

3. Is Angular an MVC framework?
Kind of; it's model view whatever (can be controller but can also be model view presenter, model view viewModel, etc.)

4. Turn to the Angular docs. Find ng-app. What is it and what does it do? What does ng stand for?
It auto-bootstraps an AngularJS application. "ng" indicates a core module in Angular and is a stand-in for the word "angular."
